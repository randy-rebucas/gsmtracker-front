Hi im randy rebucas a student of AMA online education. As required on this final activity to capture a video atleast 3 to 5 minutes on how to build self confedence or how to manage stress.
On this particular activity i decided to choose the number 2 list which was on how i manage my stress.

Ok, Here we go,

How i manage my stress?  Well! in my own way, I manage my stress by keeping my positive attitudes, deep breathing, relaxing my musscles by this i can loosen some tense muscle. aplying 4 Aâ€™s of stress management such as Avoid, Alter, Adapt and accept, controlling my fellings such instance of being angry, i sometimes went to the gym or doing exercise by this it gives me a good feeling and it can also serve as a valuable distraction from my daily worries, eating healthy and balance meals by this it can help me control my moods, taking a break and listning my favorate music, enough rest and sleep  and sometimes join social activities in my community serving some barangays that having issues on health.

thats all that i can think about. Thank you.
